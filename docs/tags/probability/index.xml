      <description>Probability problem for the nerds for today, what is the probability that two whole numbers from 1 to 1000 chosen at random are divisible without remainder (as in a/b=whole number but not necessarily b/a= whole number)
So we know that there are 1000 possibilities for the first number, and another 1000 for the second number. Given this we know that the size of the sample space space is 1000^2. Let&amp;rsquo;s also define a as the first number and b as the second number.</description>
